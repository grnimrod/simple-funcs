# Simple functions

**Exercise:** Write a function that takes three numbers as arguments and return their product.

**Exercise:** Change the function so it only takes one argument, get another from the global scope, and assigns to a local variable for the last value.

**Exercise:** Write a function that takes two lists as its input and return the longest of the two.

**Exercise:** The distance between two points, `(x1,y1)` and `(x2,y2)` is √(|`x1-x2`|²+ |`y1-y2`|²). It follows from Pythagora’s Theorem (as you should be able to see using a small drawing). Write a function that computes the distance between two functions. You can use the `sqrt()` function to get the square root, but you need to import it from the `math` module first:

```python
from math import sqrt
```
